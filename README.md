# Assignment-2
TASK 1:
The "number" variable takes the value from the user in the form of integer through input function.
After that the inputed number is being divided by 2 and its remainder is being recorded in the "remainder" variable.
After tha if function checks the value of "remainder", if it is "1" then the "number" is being printed as odd through print function otherwise the "number" is printed as even through print function.

TASK 2:
There is an "a" variable which represents the sum total of the whole range.
In for function, I have taken the range from 1 to 51 (Not 50 because then 50 will not be counted). 
Then "a += i" adds a and i from the function and updates the value of a. This process is repeated until i reaches 50 and with this the value in a has reached 1275.
After for functions ends and print function prints that the total is 1275.

Also not related to the Tasks, I have tried something in the TASK 2 file. if you have spare time i would request you to please teach me why that is happening. Thank you.
